# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

This project was built using **Xcode 16**. This branch is designed to work perfectly only with Xcode 16 or above. If you are using **Xcode 15 or below**, please switch to the branch `support/xcodes_bellow_16`.

**Note**: Due to a bug in Xcode 16, unit tests only work with simulators running iOS **below version 18**.

# üì± Pokedex App

An iOS app built to view information about Pok√©mon. Developed in **SwiftUI**, using the **MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator)**.

## ‚ú® Features

- Display a list of Pok√©mon with **pagination**.
- Search Pok√©mon by **name**, **ID**.
- Filter Pok√©mon by **types**.
- Detailed view of each Pok√©mon, including:
  - Name, number, and sprites (front and shiny images).
  - Pok√©mon types, with distinct colors.
  - Statistics.

## üß© Design System

A **design system** with **atomic components** was implemented for consistent reuse throughout the app, providing easier maintenance:

- **PDImageView**: A component that downloads images, with support for caching and placeholders.
- **PDTextField**: A custom text field following the app's design system.

## üîó Dependencies

The app was developed without external libraries.

## üé® Code Style Best Practices

- Proper **indentation and line breaks** to ensure code readability.
- **No force unwrapping**: Ensuring code safety and preventing unexpected crashes.
- **Decoupled ViewModels and Services**: Dividing responsibilities and making the code more modular.
- **Minimum deployment target: iOS 16**: For a more stable version of SwiftUI framework.
